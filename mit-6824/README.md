# Distributed Systems by MIT

## Quick Introduction
A comprehensive course on distributed systems by MIT. Its not very practical and
quite theoretical in nature, but very fundamental stuff will be taught. Will be quite
cool to implement few things from this course, although it will be like re-inventing
the wheel but will be a nice ride.
