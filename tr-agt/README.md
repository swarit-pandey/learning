## Quick Intro
This is a course taught by Tim Roughgarden on Algorithmic Game Theory, it mostly
consists of case studies, auction and mechanism design, and has a nice intersection
between CS and economics. Complements any distributed systems course very well has 
some very hardcore theoretical stuff from TCS. Apparently this course also helped bring
up the initial motivation for the Ethereum network.
