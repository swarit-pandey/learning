# Learning

## What?
Learning whatever I find interesting, no deadlines, not timeouts, just for fun. 
Anything and everything and nothing. No end goal, just pure love for come very 
esoteric and mainstream topics on practical CS (and TCS). 

## Why?
Answering this will be a contradiction to "What?".

## Some random things.
- Implementing theoretical stuff in Go. 
- Maths and notes in tex.

## Tracking
Tracking progress on [doit](https://github.com/swarit-pandey/doit).
